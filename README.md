# [URU.no](http://uru.no/)

URU is my personal website, where I create small projects (for fun!).

The current version is developed with **C# 8.0**, **[ASP.NET Core (v3.0.0 Preview 3)](https://www.microsoft.com/net)**, **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)**, **JavaScript**, and **HTML5 & CSS3**.

Have a look at the **[Offline Changeset](https://github.com/Adrrei/URU/wiki/Offline-Changeset)** for a changelog of the project before it was made public.

## Projects

Following are the projects that have been developed. Check out their wiki page for more details, or explore them on the website.
